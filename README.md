# Sleepless Signals: Modeling the Impact of Health and Age on Sleep Duration

### Project Overview

This project aims to build a regression model that, as fully as possible, describes the relationship between a person's health, age, and how much sleep they get using OLS Regression techniques and assumptions. 

### Tools

R Studio | OLS Regression | OLS Model Assumptions

### Process

1. Cleaned and filtered raw BRFSS data in R, focusing on variables related to general health, physical health, mental health, age, and sleep duration.
2. Created visualizations to explore distributions and relationships among variables using ggplot2.
3. Built and interpreted multiple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to quantify associations, while testing model assumptions such as linearity, homoscedasticity, and independence.


### Results

Our analysis found that age and self-reported mental, physical and general health were statistically significant predictors of the hours of sleep a person gets, while recognizing the complex nuances that came with interpreting the residuals and practical effect sizes. The model only explained about 3.7% of the variation in sleep hours, suggesting that more research is required to see a fuller picture of the factors that affect ones sleep patterns. However, the practical effect size was around 30-minutes less of sleep each night for those with more reported poor mental and general health days. Although it is a small amount proportionally, practically, 30 extra minutes of sleep could potentially have a noticable positive impact on a person's day. These findings highlight the nuances surrounding sleep and the external factors that affect it. 

### Key Learnings

1. Strengthened understanding of linear model diagnostics, the importance of model assumptions, and how to interpret both statistical and practical significance. 
2. Gained deeper insight into how population-level health surveys can inform personal and public health policy.
